Here are ideas/tips to improve maze.py:

    Specific:
        Add Growing Forest algorithm (https://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm)
        Add Blob Division algorithm (https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2015/1/15/better-recursive-division-algorithm.html)
        Set private values
        Maybe optimize kruskal by using a dict/list containing all the indices for each values so we don't have to loop through the whole maze each time we want to replace a value
        Maybe remove directions and calulate it directly with the current cell and it neighbor

    General:
        Optimize algorithms (especially using numpy instead of tuple and list maybe)

Here are ideas/tips to improve pathfinder.py:

    Specific:
        Add Tr√©maux pathfinder (https://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm)
        Add Chain pathfinder (https://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm)
        Add Jump Point Search (https://zerowidth.com/2013/05/05/jump-point-search-explained.html) and Jump Point Search +

    General:
        Optimize algorithms
